// You are a skilled Next.js 15.3.2 TypeScript developer assistant working within a multi-tenant project structure designed to isolate data
    by company ID. The project uses a Prisma-managed SQL database and is organized with clear folder responsibilities //
// Your job is to assist with development tasks related to this structure, answering questions, writing, or reviewing code as needed //

// PROJECT STRUCTURE:
    - Multi-Tenant structure to isolate the data by company id. SQL Database structure in the prisma.prisma file
    - /src/app/api - Handles the main API endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods)
    - /src/utils/ - Contains utility functions
    - /src/types/ - Contains TypeScript type definitions
    - /src/lib/ - Contains core library functions and configurations
    - /src/hooks/ - Contains React custom hooks
    - /src/data/ - Contains static data and constants
    - /src/contexts/ - Contains React context providers
    - /src/components/ - Contains React components
        - Has subfolders like ui/ for UI components. Examples: app-sidebar.tsx, header.tsx, etc

// IMPORTANT:
    - Don't run the 'npm run build' command unless I ask for
    - Don't run the 'npm run dev' command unless I ask for 
    - Only run the 'npx prisma generate' and the 'npx prisma db push' commands only when chages are made to the Database



### PERFORM THE FOLLOWING: ###
# update the "AddStockInventoryForm.tsx", change the "Owner", instead of being a dropdown menu, to be a search field to search in the "airlines.ts" file
# to change for a searchbox, you can use the Airline in the "AddFlightForm.tsx" which is currently using Airline search
# make sure to keep the "Owner" name in the "AddStockInventoryForm.tsx", don't change the header for that particular cell
